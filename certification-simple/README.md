# Ayra Conformance Test Suite - Certification Simple

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE - NOT PRODUCTION READY**
> 
> This is an **exploratory prototype** for conformance testing concepts. The codebase is **fragile, unstable, and subject to breaking changes**. This implementation was created for rapid prototyping and research purposes only.

> üö® **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS**
> 
> - **Highly Experimental**: This code is exploratory and may break unexpectedly
> - **Fragile Architecture**: Minor changes may cause system failures
> - **No Stability Guarantees**: APIs and functionality may change without notice
> - **Development Only**: Not suitable for production or critical environments
> - **Security Risks**: Contains known security vulnerabilities
> - **Data Loss Risk**: No persistence guarantees, data may be lost
> - **Limited Support**: Experimental codebase with minimal error handling

A **prototype** testing framework that explores validation concepts for digital wallet and verifier implementations in the **Ayra Trust Network**. This experimental CTS investigates approaches for testing SSI implementation compliance with network standards.

**Remember**: This is experimental research software. Expect issues, help improve concepts, and contribute to the learning process! üß™üî¨

For the complete documentation, please see the main repository README at `/Users/andor/workspace/github.com/ayraforum/conformance-test-suite/README.md` which contains full details about both the certification-simple and test-harness-integrated approaches.

## Quick Summary

This **certification-simple** approach is:
- ‚úÖ Good for: Research, learning, concept exploration, local experimentation
- ‚ùå Bad for: Production, customer demos, security-sensitive operations, reliable testing

See the main repository README for detailed comparisons and full documentation.
